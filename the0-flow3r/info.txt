leds: 40x WS2812C-2020-V1

the numbering system for these leds is absolutely insane. but it doesn't matter.

this mysterious SYS pin is connected in parallel to 4 sets of 10 leds. could it be the spi clock?

they're connected to these traces:
LED_SDO --> 14 --> J14 (right)
SYS --> 13 --> J13 (lef)
GND2 --> 11/15 --> J13 (left)

as I expected, J13 and J14 are connectors that connect the top and bottom pcb to each other.

J13 connects to J8
J14 connects to J9

LED_SDO --> 14 --> 	J14 --> J9 --> 14 --> LED_SDO
SYS 	--> 13 --> 	J13 --> J8 --> 13 --> LED_POWER
GND2 	--> 11/15 --> 	J13 --> J8 --> 11/15 --> mysterious arrow symbol (I assume this means ground)

if this arrow means ground, then all of these labels also mean ground:
GND, GNDA, GND2, SHIELD

continuation:

LED_SDO --> 22 --> GPIO14/TOUCH14/ADC2_CH3/FSPIWP/FSPIDQS/SUBSPIWP --> ESP32-S3-WROOM-1

LED_POWER --> 1 --> OUT --> U14 (SY6280AAAC)

the led strip data in starts on the bottom of the right petal, and goes down and around. this means I will have to shift the whole pattern around.

the round screen is described in the documentation as "compatible with GC9A01"

the connector has 18 pins? and something called MP

1
2 LEDK --> LCD_BL --> J13/J8--> GPIO46	<< TFT_BL?	<< 46, backlight
3
4
5 TP_RST --> GPIO pin of AD7147-1 captouch chip
6 TP_INT --> 
7 I2C_SDA --> GPIO2/TOUCH2/ADC1_CH1	<< TFT_MOSI?
8 I2C_SCL --> GPIO1/TOUCH1/ADC1_CH0	<< TFT_SCLK?
9
10 LCD_TE --> MTCK/GPIO39/CLK_OUT3/SUBSPICS1
11 LCD_SDO --> MTMS/GPIO42				<< 42, mosi
12 LCD_CD --> GPIO38/FSPIWP/SUBSPIWP	<< TFT_DC?	<< 38, dc
13 LCD_CKO --> MTDI/GPIO41/CLK_OUT1			<< 41, sck
14 LCD_CS --> MTDO/GPIO40/CLK_OUT2	<< TFT_CS	<< 40, cs
15 LCD_RST --> P3 of chip U7: MAX7321ATE<< TFT_RST?
16
17
18
MP

3, 9, 18, MP are all connected to GND
1, 4, 16, 17 are connected to something that has 3.3v on one side, and a C1 connecting to GND.

LEDK goes through R1 to a mosfet, which connects to GND and LCD_BL. LCD_BL --> GPIO46

I2C_SDA and I2C_SCL lead to a bunch of different points. so I'm writing down the endpoints that end in the esp32.

captouch info:

The AD7147 requires a companion algorithm that runs on the
host or another microcontroller to implement high resolution
sensor functions, such as scroll bars or wheels. However, no
companion algorithm is required to implement buttons. Button
sensors are implemented on chip, entirely in digital logic.

A square wave excitation signal is applied to CINx during
the conversion, and the modulator continuously samples the
charge going through CINx. The output of the modulator is
processed via a digital filter, and the resulting digital data is
stored in the CDC_RESULT_Sx registers for each conversion
stage, at Address 0x00B to Address 0x016.

pinout:
13 - SDA - I2C Serial Data Input/Output. SDA requires pull-up resistor.
14 - ADD0 - I2C Address Bit 0.
15 - SCLK - Clock Input for Serial Interface.
16 - ADD1 - I2C Address Bit 1.
17 - INT - General-Purpose Open-Drain Interrupt Output. Programmable polarity; requires pull-up resistor.
